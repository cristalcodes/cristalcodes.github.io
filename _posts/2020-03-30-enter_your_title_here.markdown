I know what you’re thinking- “the title says “CLI Data Project… where’s the code”?
I promise we will get there, but every story starts at the beginning.
You’re looking at Duchess. She’s been up for adoption for the last 43 weeks and no one knows why. I’ve been following her on Instagram for months now, and every single day that passes is another day I wish that I could take her in.
I often spend my time thinking about her, half hoping no one has adopted her so I can adopt her myself, half hoping her picture will stop appearing in my timeline, signifying that she’s found a new home.
This project is dedicated to her.
If code is supposed to solve real world problems, maybe this small work of love will get Duchess into a home where she can love and be loved.
