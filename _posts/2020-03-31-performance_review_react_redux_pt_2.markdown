Welcome back! If you read the previous post, you'll know that things didn't quite go as well as they could have. 

Well, I'm back to report that part two went much MUCH better. 

Lets recap! 

## Lesson 1: Catching yourself when you're talking too much is key! 

I found myself falling into the same pattern of getting too wordy. Instead of carrying on when I caught myself talking too long, I said, "I'm sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. The answer is ... " 

My assessor mentioned at the end of the assessment that I had improved significantly in not only answering the question succinctly, but also in being able to hyperfocus on the answer. No legs on the snake this time! 

## Lesson 2: Talking about your thought process is more important than getting things right. 

I had a second console.log exercise this time around, and like the last time around, I didn't get the answer 100% correct. However, I talked through my reasoning for each and every answer I gave. When the logs appeared in an order I did not expect, I provided my new logic about why I thought things logged the way they did. 

As with most things, it's okay to get things wrong, as long as you understand WHY you were wrong. If you know what went wrong, you likely know how you could have gotten it right. 

## Lesson 3: Feedback Matters 

The best thing about this assessment was that I went into it even more prepared than the last time. Having more  preparation gave me greater confidence, which reflected in how I carried through the assessment. 

But prep isn't the whole picture. My assessor was kind enough to provide me with plenty of feedback after my prior assessment. Having this data allowed me to create a tailored plan of attack, focusing on my weakest areas and tackling those areas first. 

## The takeaway: 

As software developers we understand how important it is to create tailored methods for our needs. Make sure that you tailor your methods to YOU! Gather data about how you perform, and then work on that. It may look different for you than it does anyone else. 

&& that brings up a great point- as with code, there are SO many way to arrive at the destination. You don't have to do things the way everyone else does, do it the way it would work for you. 

Wishing you all the best, I'm off to graduate!
